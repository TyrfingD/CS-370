The neural network for this game was largely implemented for me. The entirety of the "GameExperience" and "TreasureMaze" PY methods were prewritten, as well as most of the main IPYNB file.
For my own contribution, I followed the guidelines and feedback provided to create the loop over which the in-game pirate agent will attempt to move through the game for one episode, record its movement path and the results, and then use those results to determine the next episodeâ€™s path (unless the next episode is an exploratory one). Even then, I had a lot of help from my instructor who edited my code to create conditions and variables that work.
Computer Scientists may be asked to not only write code, but to maintain, analyse, update, edit, or secure software. This job has become more important as more aspects of our lives have become reliant on computer software.
As a computer scientists there are several guidelines I have been taught to follow. Simple, readable, reusable code ettiquite are some considerations. Others include creating secure software that does not take, abuse, or expose user's personal information. Even futher concerns could include questions like "does my software discriminate against any portion of my potential userbase?". "Does my software cause harm to anyone, anywhere?".
